            <br>
           <br>
             The Southern Brook Lamprey (<i>Ichthyomyzon gagei</i>) is a primitive, nonparasitic, filiform fish that inhabits streams of the Southeastern USA. Little is known about the species, especially in their cryptic larval form (i.e., ammocoetes) which burrow into fine sediment. As part of a comprehensive study of the species' ecology in Mississippi, we are surgically implanting passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags into the peritoneal cavity of ammocoetes to inform studies attempting to describe patterns of population structure and identify factors that affect the metamorphosis of ammocoetes to the adult lifestage. By understanding the important triggers for metamorphosis we expect to inform management efforts to benefit reproductive opportunities and recruitment of this sensitive indicator species.

            <br>
           <br>
            Effective monitoring of at-risk or declining species is fundamental to inform conservation and monitor the effectiveness of management efforts. More than half (58%) of madtom species (Noturus spp.) are considered imperiled, and consequently, these fishes are regularly targeted during sampling conducted by management agencies. The effectiveness of these sampling efforts has been questioned, due to the cryptic and suspected nocturnal behaviors of madtoms. We evaluated the suitability of small (8.4 x 1.4 mm), surgically implanted passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for ecological studies of patterned madtoms using Freckelbelly Madtom, <i>Noturus munitus</i>. Using novel, PIT tag transmitting artificial cover units, we also described an efficient method to index madtom abundance and are developing new understanding of madtom social behaviors and activity patterns. <br>

            <br>
           <br>
            The Farmer’s Almanac “fishing calendar” predicts daily fishing condition and while the exact formula is unknown, the forecasts are widely accepted in popular culture. We attempted to corroborate historic fishing conditions using creel data collected from Enid Lake, northcentral Mississippi. The influence of year and fishing condition was evaluated by parameterizing models that included and excluded their effect on catch rates. Negligible separation between models that included the influence of year, forecasted fishing condition, and year + fishing interaction when compared to the null model suggests that these factors had little effect on catch rates. Large news corporations (WTVA, Tupelo MS) and numerous web-based resources provide fishing forecasts that are largely unsubstantiated.

            <br>
           <br>
            Erratic hydrologic disturbances and extreme environmental pressures regulate prairie fish abundance and distribution. Local extirpation is common and species persistence is dependent on life history traits that faciliate dispersal over large areas. Lost connectivity in lotic networks has severed historic movement pathways and increased the extinction risk of many small-bodied prairie fishes. We described the susceptibility of small-bodied fishes to stream fragmentation and the consequent risk to ecosystem function by quantifying the jumping abilities of four plains fishes. <br>

           <br>
            Crayfish can have strong impacts on food webs and trophic systems in prairie streams, particularly in ecosystems with few or no fish species. Although crayfish can become abundant in prairie systems, little is known about the interactions among sympatric crayfish species. Following riparian restoration efforts, we are evaluating the environmental factors that regulate the abundance and biotic interactions of two crayfish species in eastern South Dakota.

            <br>
           <br>
           Abundance and fish community metrics are typically estimated with mark-recapture or maximum-likelihood depletion techniques, but considerable sampling effort is required to quantify these parameters. Less intensive sampling approaches may be beneficial to fisheries managers, particularly in cases where frequent sampling of many locations is required. We compared catch rates and community metrics generated from single-pass and multiple-pass electrofishing in Great Plains streams and linked the species-specific relationships to instream habitat conditions. Using a single-pass protocol, we obtained equivalent relative abundance data in approximately three fewer hours per site. Ultimately, managers can expect to capture most species effectively with one electrofishing pass in proportions reflective of their estimated abundance. However, single-pass electrofishing may be unreliable when managers are attempting to detect rare species and is biased by habitat features that congregate or facilitate the escape of certain fishes. <br>

           <br>
            Small PIT (8.4 x 1.4 mm) tags offer numerous applications to further our understanding of small-bodied fish ecology; however, the effectiveness of various implantation practices has not been empirically compared. We evaluated the effectiveness of cyanoacrylate (superglue) as a suturing agent to improve retention of PIT tags for three fishes, relative to no suturing agent, following surgical implantation. The suturing procedure  improved survival of madtom and shiner species, but increased mortality of darters. Generally tag ejections were reduced and healing rates were rapid when sutured compared to non-sutured treatments. No significant differences were observed in relative daily growth rates of sutured and non-sutured treatments for all species. These results could lead to improvements in the suitability of PIT tag insertion techniques for small-bodied fishes. <br>

            <br>
           <br>
            Prairie stream fish assemblages experience seasonal shifts in habitat conditions, often coupled with powerful disturbance regimes, where systems fluctuate widely between drought and deluge. These abiotic drivers, more often than biotic factors, structure fish assemblages. Many plains fishes have life history traits that facilitate the wide dispersal and immediate contribution of offspring following disturbance events. However, descriptions of temporal and spatial patterns in larval assemblage structure in prairie streams are scarce, and few studies evaluate the effect of disturbances on reproduction. We studied the timing and contribution of native prairie stream fishes to drifting larval fish assemblages in three eastern South Dakota basins (Vermillion, James, and Big Sioux) and described larval fish responses to floods in the James River. <br>

            <p class="lead"><b>UNEQUAL RANGING ABILITIES OF PRAIRIE FISHES: WHAT IS A HORIZONTAL BARRIER TO FISH MOVEMENT?</b>
            <br>
           <br>
            Fish movement is important to population maintenance and critical to the recolonization of extirpated areas in dynamic prairie streams. Lost connectivity throughout lotic networks has severed historic pathways and increases the local extinction risk of many small-bodied fishes. We quantified the swimming abilities of four plains fishes to describe their vulnerability to widespread barriers associated with road crossings. Swimming endurance varied considerably among species demonstrating the unequal susceptibility of prairie fishes to population fragmentation by anthropogenic barriers. Continued interruption of lotic corridors will negatively impact local assemblage structure by favoring colonization by stronger swimming species. Future barrier mitigation activities will benefit from this increased understanding of fish swimming ability as it relates to fish ranging behaviors and subsequent changes to local system ecology.    <br>
