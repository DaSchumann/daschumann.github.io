            <br>
            <br>
Access to floodplain habitats by dependent fishes is limited by anthropogenic modifications of the Lower Mississippi River to facilitate navigation and commerce. Today, fewer floodplain areas are inundated less frequently in channelized reaches of the Lower Mississippi River. We are engaging federal, state, NGO, private, and recreational stakeholders in the region using a structured decision making framework to improve floodplain habitats for Alligator Gar and other fish reproduction. By understanding the relative responsiveness of different taxa to proposed management actions, we are identifying appropriate locations for management actions and the trade-offs among differing strategies used to inundate and reconnect floodplain habitats.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
The equitable allocation of limited conservation resources requires the prioritization of regions, species, or populations for management action. Many aquatic taxa are understudied and lack data necessary to assess extinction risk using prominent methods (e.g. IUCN Red List). Consequently, current conservation status has only been evaluated for ~20% of fishes, despite their relatively high extinction risk. We developed a repeatable and transparent method to identify fishes in need of conservation attention that is consistent with the concepts of redundancy, resiliency, and representation and applicable at any geographic or adminstrative scale. Our Bayes Net model utilizes accessible biological criteria (i.e. life history, ecological traits, museum databases) and well-known threats to set conservation priorities for fishes regardless of species knowledge. This model is broadly applicable to aquatic taxa worldwide and will be particularly useful when applied to highly diverse regions with many poorly known species.

            <b>A STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING APPROACH TO SUPPORT A DEVELOPING STATE WILDLIFE ACTION PLAN: CONSERVATION OF PLAINS TOPMINNOW IN NEBRASKA</b>
            <br>
            <br>
In response to dramatic declines in  geographic range and local abundance a team of managers in Nebraska are developing a State Wildlife Action Plan for Plains Topminnow to inform its future conservation. In support of this conservation initiative, we developed a Bayesian decision network model to help decision makers identify appropriate and cost-effective methods to manage stream reaches to maximize topminnow persistence. Our model predicts the relative influence of competing management alternatives on future topminnow occupancy using the collective effects of biological, chemical, and physical criteria thought to influence the species. Biologists can now promptly identify optimal management actions and best allocate limited resources to maximize topminnow persistence. We have mobilized a conservation plan to reach transparent and defensible management decisions; a process relevant to diverse taxa of conservation significance. <br>

    <br>
    <br>
Many conservation programs exist to restore ecological processes in damaged riparian areas and benefit stream ecosystems in hopes to elict responses from aquatic taxa. We quantified the indirect effect of largescale grassland conservation efforts on aquatic taxa in a highly degraded river basin. Despite  improvements to stream environments, assemblages have yet to respond to conservation efforts. These conclusions remind us that anecdotes are dangerous and although, at times aesthetically more appealing, not all attempts to restore habitats are equally able to yield measureable benefits. In reality, "if you build it, they may not actually come", for a number of different reasons.<br>

            We assessed alternative conservation strategies and generated basic knowledge of a small-bodied prairie fish of management interest, the Plains Topminnow. We integrated both federal and state agency partners, to fill important knowledge gaps in our understanding of this species' ecology and life-history. My collaborations helped systematically identify research questions and population bottlenecks to improve future conservation strategies. Our combination of basic and applied research has led the State of Nebraska to develop a statewide management plan for Plains Topminnow, the first ever management plan for an aquatic species in the state.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Innovative conservation tools are critical as freshwater fishes are lost at unprecedented rates.
Recent advances in passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology may facilitate the tagging of small species and early life stages of larger species, but currently little is known about their suitability when implanted into small fishes. We evaluated the appropriateness of these tags for nine fish species of different taxonomic groups and body configurations. Impacts of surgically implanted PIT tags were taxa specific, but generally minor. Applications of this technology are plentiful for many small-bodied fishes given little tag loss, uncompromised growth rates, and unchanged behaviors. However, managers tagging darters, dace, and small sturgeon should expect high tag loss and worsened swimming performance.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Plains topminnow have experienced declines in geographic range and local abundance, which has led to regional protection throughout its native range. Conservation of this species may even require introductions to reestablish populations at known historic locations. We constructed a pond to house a refuge population of plains topminnow in Nebraska. A total of 123 plains topminnow were stocked into the pond and, in two years mark–recapture population estimates suggested that >9,000 individuals were in the pond. Year-class stregnth was variabile. Extensive culture seems to be an effective way to rear plains topminnow and related species. However, more research is needed to determine factors that affect year-class strength and production.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
Although instream barriers are thought to fragment and ultimately displace prairie fish populations downstream, the relative vulnerability and ecological consequences of lost diversity above barriers is largely unknown. We described each species' ability to access (jumping aptitude) and successfully traverse (swimming endurance) simulated instream barriers. We than used experimental streams to identify the consequent risk to stream ecosystem processes if species are unable to recolonize following regular extirpation events. All species failed to circumvent relatively minor obstacles and each had unique effects of ecosystem structure. The risk of systematic species loss above barriers greatly outweighs the opportunity for improvement (i.e., ecological ratchet) suggesting that ecosystem structure could be moving downstream.<br>

            Trophic dynamics are often described by following the exchange of naturally occurring isotopes through aquatic communities, but inferences can be misleading when the time period and discrimination represented by isotopic measures are unknown. We conducted a laboratory diet-shift experiment to describe isotopic assimilation rates and discrimination factors in two age-0 walleye tissues. The assumption that young walleye tissues are in equilibrium with their diet is untrue for weeks following a diet shift and, when incorporated, discrimination factors differ between tissues. This research compliments a broad body of work pertaining to isotope ecology and isotopic incorporation into animal tissues following diet changes. We provide tissue-specific parameters that remove uncertainty associated with the analysis of field collected isotopic age-0 walleye data.<br>

            Investigation of predator-prey relationships that involve aquatic insects has received little attention, and aspects including feeding rates and prey selection of many predators are poorly understood. Adult giant water-bugs, <i>Lethocerus americanus</i>, and larval giant water scavenger beetles, <i>Hydrophilis triangularis</i>, are large predatory aquatic insects that typically inhabit pools or ponds with little to no flow. Laboratory trials were conducted to determine feeding rates and prey selection of a small fish species, western mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia affinis</i>), by these invertebrate predators. Each of the insect predators consumed a significantly greater number of mosquitofish from the adult size class with giant water-bugs consuming 0.13 fish per day and water scavenger beetles consuming 0.46 fish per day. Insect predation of small fish species could be substantial and because size selective pressures exist, population structure of fish populations may be affected.<br>

              <b>UTILIZING PASSIVE INTEGRATED TRANSPONDER (PIT) TAG TECHNOLOGY TO STUDY LAMPREY AMMOCOETE ECOLOGY AND POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Few studies have been published on the biology of the southern brook lamprey (Ichthyomyzon gagei)–a primitive, nonparasitic, filiform fish. Relatively little is known about the species, especially in their cryptic larval form (i.e., ammocoetes) when they burrow into fine sediments. I am collaborating with several graduate and undergraduate students to better understand the seasonal movement patterns, burrowing behaviors, and population dynamics of these fish using surgically implanted PIT tags.   <br>
