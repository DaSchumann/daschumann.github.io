We test ecological hypotheses to generate knowledge about diverse populations of aquatic taxa, communities, and entire aquatic ecosystems which can be applied to stakeholder derived objectives and action alternatives.  <br>

      <b> Student Researcher: Avery Lettenberger</b><br>
      <br>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Plains Topminnow <i>Fundulus sciadicus</i> are endemic to the Great Plains, and because of declines in their geographic range and local abundance are granted protection throughout their native range. A team of managers in Nebraska are developing a State Wildlife Action Plan, the first for an aquatic taxon in the state, to inform the species’ conservation. In support of this conservation initiative, I am developing a Bayesian decision network model to help decision makers identify appropriate and cost-effective methods to manage stream reaches to maximize topminnow persistence. </p>

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Grass Carp movements and behaviors to in response to baiting stations</h4>
      <b> Student Researcher: Max Monfort</b><br>
      <br>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Invasive species threaten biodiversity. Invasive species (e.g., grass carp) can create implications in trophic dynamics and food web interactions. Grass carp characteristics in pool 19 of the Mississippi River are poorly understood. Assessing the effectiveness of automated bait delivery systems could reveal if grass carp can be aggregated for efficient removals. Utilizing acoustic telemetry to evaluate movement and habitat use pre and post addition of baiting stations could disentangle the unknowns and better inform management within the Mississippi River Basin. <br></p>

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Fish Co-occurrence Patterns in the Driftless Area</h4>
      <b> Student Researcher: Evan Sirianni</b><br>
      <br>
      <p class="list-group-item-text"> Freshwater sculpins play important roles as both predators and prey in coldwater stream systems worldwide. Historically, Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin were abundant throughout Wisconsin Driftless Area streams. However, past land management practices altered these ecosystems and caused the extirpation of sculpin from majority of coldwater streams. Sculpin populations have since recovered in many streams from natural recolonization and reintroduction efforts. Due to their high sensitivity to environmental changes, sculpins are used as sentinel species of anthropogenic impact in stream systems. Despite this, little is known about their basic ecology in the Driftless Area leaving knowledge gaps that could inform better management practices. Our goal is to better understand the occurrence patterns of Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin within the Wisconsin Driftless Area to support future management and reintroduction efforts.  <br></p>

      <br>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Raising Lake Sturgeon is a long process that takes roughly 5 months. Feeding the standard diet for that period is costly and labor intensive. Finding a cost-effective alternative diet is beneficial for the continuation of conservation stocking efforts to supplement recruitment of this important native species.We will describe the behavioral feeding responses of larval Lake Sturgeon and palpability of a suite of potential formulated diets in a hatchery setting. <br></p>

          <p class="lead">
Decision makers must select management actions from a diverse candidate pool (e.g., restoring habitat, protecting areas, reducing anthropogenic mortality) without certain outcomes by weighing projected biological responses, implementation costs, and social pressures against associated doubt. By deconstructing decision problems for deliberation and capturing important ecological and population processes and uncertainties, our use of SDM strategies and novel informative tools help identify management actions most likely to achieve the desires of key stakeholders while meeting biological objectives.

      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Bayes Nets & Species Conservation</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Conservation prioritization frameworks are used worldwide to identify speciesat greatest risk of extinction and to allocate limited resources across regions, species, and populations. Conservation prioritization can be impeded by ecological knowledge gaps and data deficiency, especially in freshwater species inhabiting highly complex aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we developed a flexible approach that calculates a species’ imperilment risk based on the conservation principles of resiliency, redundancy, and representation (i.e., the “three R’s”). Our approach organizes data on species traits, distributions, population connectivity, and threats within a Bayesian belief network capable of predicting resiliency and redundancy within representative ecological settings.</p>

Many conservation programs exist to restore ecological processes in damaged riparian areas to benefit aquatic ecosystems. Improvements to water quality and the diversification of habitats are expected to elicit responses from aquatic taxa, but these efforts rarely achieve biological goals. We evaluate the processes that create and maintain diverse aquatic habitats and quantify the influences of conservation activities on fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages and population dynamics.     <br><br>

           <p class="list-group-item-text">Relatively little ecological knowledge exists for many small-bodied, nongame fish despite being disproportionately represented by species at-risk of extinction. South Dakota's Wildlife Action Plan currently includes four relatively understudied fish species found in the Black Hills Fish Management Area. Explanations for the documented declines of these species, particularly Lake Chub and Longnose Sucker, are currently unavailable. Management decision-making is currently hindered by a lack of primary distributional data, limited understanding of the genetic interrelatedness of populations, and a general inability to predict the response patterns of these species to changing ecosystems. <br></p>

UThe uncertain phylogenetics of this lineage, and classifications of certain species are often questioned. This research will provide new evidence about the evolutionary relationships of Southern Brook Lamprey populations to inform conservation efforts for the populations in Wisconsin. By assuming that Southern Brook Lamprey found in Wisconsin are genetically synonymous with specimens from its southern range, we may poorly quantify the ecological representation of this species globally. </p>
