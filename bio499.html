                   <ul> 
                  <li><p class="lead"><b>Protect the integrity of your data sheets and physical samples. </b>Data sheets and notebooks contain vital information for completing your science. Record clear data and use comments to describe field and laboratory conditions. Once completed, original datasheets should be photocopied and archived in a secure location. Data should be entered from the photocopies and the original datasheets should not be modified. If you have collected physical samples, make sure you keeps records of where they are stored and share those records with me. Everything should be labeled carefully, with your name, date, any perservative chemicals, and other information important to your material. Ethanol, formalin, and other hazardous chemicals will be stored following established lab saftey protocols. </li>
                  <li><p class="lead"><b>Protect your data and writing. </b>You need to have a clear, systematic back up system that is updated at least weekly. This may include cloud backups for data (e.g., Google Drive, Carbonite, Sugar Sync, Dropbox, Box) or a physical system such as an external drive that remains in your office or home.</li>
                  <li><p class="lead"><b>Pay attention to your email.</b> There are many ways of communicating. Use them to your advantage, but you must be responsible for anything sent by email, please check it regularly and respond to actionable emails in a timely fashion. The details of an email contain clues as to whether you need to respond or not. If the email is directly sent to you then you should probably respond with a reply or a simple acknowledgment that you received the email. </li>
                  <li><p class="lead"><b>Do semester reports.</b> At the beginning of each major semester (Spring, Summer, Fall), I require two parts.<ol>
                  <li><p class="lead">An updated CV (should be as lengthy as needed)</li>
                  <li><p class="lead">A short report - 2 pages maximum (1 page is preferable) making good use of text and bullets. This exercise provides quick insight into how we might help you develop to meet your future goals and the ability to identify what actions I as an advisor may need to take. I will use this to assess your progress at the completion of the semester. </li>
                  </li><ul>
                  <li>Classes you are taking with days and times</li>
                  <li>A reflection on what you have done since your last report</li>
                  <li>What you plan to do over the next semester with specific objectives. These objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-Related) to the extent possible</li>
                  <li>Any actionable program needs. This can be extra tutorials on analyses, laboratory needs, research needs (e.g., sampling help, equipment repairs)</li>
                  <li>Presentations and meetings you plan or hope to attend.</li>
                  <li>Where you anticipate being in 5 years.</li></ul></ol>

              <li><p class="lead"><b>Submit a blog post. </b>You are also required to submit 1 blog post to be highlighted on the lab <a href="https://daschumann.github.io/"> website </a>. These posts will serve to update others on the progress of your research and call attention to the neat studies you all are working on. A template can be found <a href="https://mcolvin.github.io/post-template.docx">here </a>. The post is intended to be short and place more emphasis on photos and other media, but they can be as long as you want.</li>

            <h2 class="section-heading"> Guidelines  </h2>
                   <ul> 
                   <li><p class="lead"><b>Design careful experiments, observational studies, and analyses. </b>Consider alternative hypotheses. Run power analyses on dummy datasets. Do all the right controls. “To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.” Ronald Fisher.</li>
                   
<li><p class="lead"><b>Visualize your hypotheses and your results effectively.</b> Become a master of clear figures, appropriate to the data and show distributions.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>Develop a workflow management system.</b> It is difficult to manage the increasing number of assignments, meetings, and other work requirements vying for your time. A workflow management system helps keep things from falling through the cracks and missed deadlines. This can be a simple a using a calendar or a notebook. I use a notebook with a simple bullet system to keep track of things. There are many digital ways to manage workflow like google keep, Wunderlist, Todoist, Evernote, and so on. In my experience this is really a personal preference and may take several attempts to find one that works for you.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>Develop a uniform file architecture for your projects and analyses.</b> Having a uniform file architecture helps immensely when you are working on multiple research projects (thesis chapters can be thought of as separate projects), returning to a project after some time away, or working with collaborators.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>Develop methods and protocols before sampling.</b> This is particularly important for undergrads and people new to the group and will help a lot with writing.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>Ask questions all the time and learn new things. </b>We all have a lot to learn and can do this by helping others and learning ourselves. Take continuing education courses, talk to other lab members and learn specific analyses or skillsets, whether they be techniques, approaches, or something else,  active learning is always good.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>	Be helpful. </b>You might know something that could be helpful to someone else that you realize before they do. Take the initiative and talk to them. Science is not a zero-sum game.</li>
<li><p class="lead"><b>Talk to people outside our research group. </b>There are people outside our group who know things we do not know, and they can help.</li>

<li><p class="lead">Report any safety issue, large or small. </li>
<li><p class="lead">Clean up after yourself and leave all areas neat and clean. It is very important when working in shared areas that you do not leave a mess anywhere. Everything should be labeled with your name and date.</li>
<li><p class="lead">Help other students with field work and analyses. Helping fellow students with field work and analyses is a great way to gather additional experience, build a network, and synergistic activity. However, do not become a free technician, your research comes first.</b>

            <h2 class="section-heading"> Academic Integrity and Misconduct  </h2>
            <p class="lead">Academic misconduct is a violation of the UWL Student Honor Code (<a href="http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/studentconduct/">here</a>) and is unacceptable. I expect you to submit your own original work and participate in the course with integrity and high standards of academic honesty. When appropriate, cite original sources, following the style rules of our discipline. 
<br><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> whenever a grade penalty is imposed due to academic misconduct, the instructor is required to write a letter documenting the misconduct. Copies are sent to the student, to the Office of Student Life (where the letter remains on file in the student’s record), and to the Dean of the student’s College. Refer <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/student-resources/student-handbook/"> here</a> for a detailed definition of academic misconduct, and for possible sanctions and consequences. The Office of Student Life can also assist.<br>
<br>
Plagiarism or cheating in any form may result in failure of the assignment or the entire course, and may include harsher sanctions. Refer to the Student Handbook #14.02 (<a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/student-resources/student-handbook/#tm-academic-misconduct--chapter-uws-14-">website</a>) for a detailed definition of academic misconduct. For helpful information on how to avoid plagiarism, go to “Avoiding Plagiarism” on the Murphy Library (<a href="http://libguides.uwlax.edu/plagiarism2">website</a>). You may also visit the <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/"> Office of Student Life</a> if you have questions about plagiarism or cheating incidents. Failure to understand what constitutes plagiarism or cheating is not a valid excuse for engaging in academic misconduct. 
</p>
<h4>Concerns or Complaints </h4>
<p class="lead">If you have a concern or a complaint about the course, or me, I encourage you to bring that to my attention. My hope would be that by communicating your concern we would be able to come to a resolution. If you are uncomfortable speaking with me, or you feel your concern hasn’t been resolved after bringing it to my attention, you can contact my department chair: Dr. Michael Abler (mabler@uwlax.edu; (608) 785-6962).<br>
The Student Academic Non-Grade Appeals process can be found in the <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/student-resources/student-handbook/#tm-non-academic-misconduct--chapter-uws-17-">Student Handbook</a>. For more information on appealing a final grade, see <a href="http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/gradesgradingtesting/#appeal-final-grade">here </a> in the Undergraduate Catalog.
<h4>Inclusive Excellence </h4>
<p class="lead">UWL’s core values include “Diversity, equity, and the inclusion and engagement of all people in a safe campus climate that embraces and respects the innumerable different perspectives found within an increasingly integrated and culturally diverse global community" <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/chancellor/mission/"> Mission Statement</a>. If you are not experiencing my class in this manner, please come talk to me about your experiences so I can try to adjust the course if possible.   
<h4>Names/Pronouns </h4>
<p class="lead">I will do my best to address you by a preferred name or gender pronoun that you have identified. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. Information on UWL’s preferred name policy is available <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/records/preferred-name/">here </a> and UWL’s Pride Center is available for additional assistance.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Our Legal Obligations to You</h2>
<h4>Sexual Misconduct</h4>
<p class="lead">As an employee of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, I am a mandated reporter of sexual harassment and sexual violence that takes place on campus or otherwise affects the campus community. This means that if I receive detailed or specific information about an incident such as the date, time, location, or identity of the people involved, I am obligated to share this with UWL’s Title IX Coordinator (<a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/equity/">more information</a>) in order to enable the university to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and rights of all involved. For students not wishing to make an official report, there are confidential resources available to provide support and discuss the available options. The contact in Student Life is Ingrid Peterson, Violence Prevention Specialist, (608) 785-8062, ipeterson@uwlax.edu. Please see <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/sexual-misconduct">this website</a> for more resources or to file a report. </p>
<h4>Religious Accomondations</h4>
<p class="lead">Per the <a href="http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/aboutuwlax/#accommodation-religious-beliefs">UWL Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs</a>:“any student with a conflict between an academic requirement and any religious observance must be given an alternative means of meeting the academic requirement. The student must notify the instructor within the first three weeks of class (within the first week of summer session and short courses) of specific days/dates for which the student will request an accommodation. Instructors may schedule a make-up examination or other academic requirement before or after the regularly scheduled examination or other academic requirement.”  
<h4>Students with Disabilities</h4>
<p class="lead">Any student with a documented disability (e.g. ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Acquired Brain Injury, PTSD, Physical, Sensory, Psychological, or Learning Disability) who needs to arrange academic accommodations must contact The ACCESS Center (165 Murphy Library, 608-785-6900, ACCESSCenter@uwlax.edu) and meet with an advisor to register and develop an accommodation plan.  In addition to registering with The ACCESS Center, it is the student's responsibility to discuss their academic needs with their instructors. 
You can find out more about services available to students with disabilities at The ACCESS Center <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/access-center"> website</a>.
</p>
<h4>Veterans and Active Military Personnel</h4>
<p class="lead"> Veterans and active military personnel with special circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill requirements, disabilities) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to me. For additional information and assistance, contact the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/veteran-services/"> Veterans Services Office</a>.  Students who need to withdraw from class or from the university due to military orders should be aware of the <a href="http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/withdrawal/#military-duty-withdrawal-university"> military duty withdrawal policy </a>.</p>
